# How to install and enable

1. Open your vault root folder in your OS file explorer
2. Open the `.obsidian` folder and create a new folder called `snippets`
3. Download and paste the `explorer-with-icons.css` of this repository inside of the `snippets` folder
4. In Obsidian, open the settings in the appearance section, scroll down to the end and enable the snippet

> [!NOTE]
> The icon color is hardcoded in the SVG. If you want it in a different color, you can modify the `stroke` property for each SVG.
